# JavaDB Database Project

This project demonstrates how to work with a database using JavaDB. 

## Database Setup

- **Database Name**: `MyDatabase`
- **Username**: `MyUser`
- **Password**: `JavaDb840`

### Table Structure

The project uses a table named `MyTable`, which has the following columns:
- **Name**: `VARCHAR`
- **Family**: `VARCHAR`
- **Phone**: `VARCHAR`

### Project Overview

In this project, a connection is established to the JavaDB database using the provided credentials. The program retrieves records from the `MyTable`, adds a new record for a user named Elham Shirazi, deletes that record, and updates the phone number for another user named Reza Tabrizi. The Derby client library (`derbyclient.jar`) must be included in the project to enable JDBC connectivity.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a simple introduction to working with databases in Java using JavaDB. You can modify the code to suit your own database structure and requirements.
